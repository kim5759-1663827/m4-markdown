# Exercise-2

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)


# cp

The `cp` command can be used to _copy_ a file or folder. For example: 
```
cp my-photo.png my-photo.2png
```
Here's some more information about the `cp` command:
- It can be used to _recursively_ copy a directory with the `-R` option: `cp -R folder-1 folder-2`
- You can print out progress to the terminal using the `-v` command, making it _verbose_: `cp -R -v folder-1 folder-2` 

See `complete` branch for answers.
